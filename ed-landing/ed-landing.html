		<h2>Common questions</h2>
		<button class="accordion">What are the symptoms of erectile dysfunction?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>The main symptom of erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to get and maintain an erection for satisfactory intercourse. 
			<p>ED should not be confused with ejaculation problems such as premature ejaculation, which is a condition where the process of arousal, orgasm and ejaculation occurs very rapidly.</p>
			<p>Sometimes ED only occurs in certain situations. For example, you may be able to get an erection during masturbation, or you may find that you sometimes wake up with an erection but you are unable to get an erection with your sexual partner.</p>
			<p>In these circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause of ED is primarily psychological (stress related). However, if you are unable to get an erection under any circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause is primarily physical.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">What's the difference between Sildenafil and Viagra?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Sildenafil is the active ingredient in Viagra. Viagra is the brand name that Pfizer (the original company that discovered the chemical and marketed this type of medication) gave to the product. Once Pfizerâ€™s patent expired in 2013, other manufacturers aside from Pfizer were able to produce and sell medication containing sildenafil, but still are not allowed to use the Viagra brand name. The active ingredients in Sildenafil are identical to Viagra. Viagra is simply a branded, more expensive version. </p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">How does Sildenafil work?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Normally, for men who suffer with ED, the blood vessels that feed the penis are narrowed and do not allow sufficient blood flow to this area. Without sufficient blood flow to the penis an erection cannot be achieved. Sildenafil works by expanding the blood vessels that feed the penis, this increased amount of blood allows for a stronger erection. It is important to note that Sildenafil will not make you sexually stimulated or raise your libido on its own.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">How long does it last?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Sildenafil tablets normally last for around 4-6 hours after they begin to take effect. You should be able to achieve a satisfactory erection in this period.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">How long will my erection last after sex?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Sildenafil doesnâ€™t stop your erection going down after ejaculation - your erection should go away after you have had sex.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">How long does it take to work?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>As a general rule you should take sildenafil tablets up to 1 hour before having sex. It will normally begin to work anywhere between 30 minutes and 1 hour after you take it. The time it takes to take effect can vary from person to person, as well as external factors, such as when you last ate.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">Can I take it as often as I want?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>You should only take one tablet in a 24-hour period.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">What happens if it doesn't work?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Sildenafil (and other ED treatments) are not always effective for everyone the first time they take them. Official advice is that you should try a dose up to 8 times before deciding that it is ineffective. If you still find that it is ineffective after multiple attempts, you should speak to your doctor about alternative treatment options.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">Do I need a prescription to buy Sildenafil tablets?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Yes - our doctors will write a private prescription for our pharmacy if they deem it safe and appropriate after your online consultation.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Safety questions</h2>
		<button class="accordion">What dosage should I take?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>The starting dose for most men is 50mg. You should only switch to 100mg if the effects are not strong enough. If you have existing heart conditions, you should talk to your doctor about starting sildenafil - they may decide that 25mg is a better option for you.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">Is it safe?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Yes - as long as patients answer questions truthfully, accurately, and completely.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">Is it safe to use Sildenafil alongside other medication?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>You should avoid the following: Nitrates (glyceryl trinitrate spray & isosorbide mononitrate or dinitrate), Poppers (amyl nitrate), Protease inhibitors (HIV treatment) and Alpha-blockers (doxazosin, prazosin, or terazosin).</p>
			<p>As all ED treatments work in a similar way, you should not take any other ED treatments (such as Viagra, Cialis, Tadalafil, or Levitra) within 24 hours of sildenafil. Always speak to your doctor or pharmacist before seeking alternative ED treatments.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">What are the possible side effects of Sildenafil tablets?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Side effects may include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Dizziness / lightheadedness</li>
				<li>Headache</li>
				<li>Flushing</li>
				<li>Heartburn or indigestion</li>

				<li>Trouble sleeping</li>
				<li>Oedema (swollen hands, ankles or feet)</li>
				<li>Visual disturbances (blurred vision/ increased sensitivity to blue-green colour blindness)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you experience any serious side effects or reactions, such as chest pain, dizziness, facial swelling or skin reactions whilst taking Sildenafil you should seek medical attention immediately.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">What If I take too much?</button>
		<div class="panel">
