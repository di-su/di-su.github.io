          <h1>Hello! I'm Di ðŸ‘‹</h1>
          <h2>This is my application to Founders and Coders, Spring 2021</h2>
          <p>I'm applying for Founders and Coders because I'm serious about pursuing a career in web development. I'm really excited about the idea of collab, peer-led learning and I feel it's an environment that I will thrive in.</p>
          <p>A little about me: I'm a 27 year old Finance & Business graduate from the University of Sussex. My latest/current role is as Head of Marketing @ <a target="_blank "href="https://www.cornerstone.co.uk/">Cornerstone.co.uk</a>, a D2C subscription-based startup based in London. As a small company of less than 10 people, I've had the opportunity to learn a huge amount on all things tech and business is only a few years.</p>
          <p>I joined Cornerstone with <u>0 development and marketing experience</u>. Through consistent effort and dedication, today I've become a very technical, successful marketer. I've made countless marketing landing pages and emails using HTML & CSS. I work closely with our in-house developers (working with Agile, overseeing sprints & creating comprehensive tickets). I have also made small deployments to our codebase with Github. I've worked with Shopify, Mailchimp and AWS too. I've had the opportunity to learn a lot of web development skills within my marketing role, and I've come to find a passion for it. This has lead me to search for ways to move into web development for real.</p>
          <p>When I found Founders and Coders on Google, I knew I couldn't miss this incredible opportunity to kick-start my professional career in web development. With a lot of self-learning experience under my belt and determination to make this application, I completed all application requirements in around 3 weeks.</p>
          <p>I want to prove that it's possible to make a career shift with passion and determination to work hard. I hope to hear from you!</p>
          <p>Thank you, Di</p>
