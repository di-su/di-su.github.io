					<h1>What is Finasteride?</h1>
					<p>It's a little pill, taken to decrease the production of DHT (dihydrotestosterone) in your body, the primary hormone responsible for hair loss in men.</p>
					<p>Clinical studies show that 9 out of 10 men taking Finasteride experience increased hair regrowth or diminished hair loss.</p>

		<h2>Common questions</h2>
		<button class="accordion">What are the symptoms of erectile dysfunction?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>The main symptom of erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to get and maintain an erection for satisfactory intercourse. 
			<p>ED should not be confused with ejaculation problems such as premature ejaculation, which is a condition where the process of arousal, orgasm and ejaculation occurs very rapidly.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">What's the difference between Sildenafil and Viagra?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Sildenafil is the active ingredient in Viagra. Viagra is the brand name that Pfizer (the original company that discovered the chemical and marketed this type of medication) gave to the product. Once Pfizerâ€™s patent expired in 2013, other manufacturers aside from Pfizer were able to produce and sell medication containing sildenafil, but still are not allowed to use the Viagra brand name. The active ingredients in Sildenafil are identical to Viagra. Viagra is simply a branded, more expensive version. </p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">How does Sildenafil work?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Normally, for men who suffer with ED, the blood vessels that feed the penis are narrowed and do not allow sufficient blood flow to this area. Without sufficient blood flow to the penis an erection cannot be achieved. Sildenafil works by expanding the blood vessels that feed the penis, this increased amount of blood allows for a stronger erection. It is important to note that Sildenafil will not make you sexually stimulated or raise your libido on its own.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">How long does it last?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Sildenafil tablets normally last for around 4-6 hours after they begin to take effect. You should be able to achieve a satisfactory erection in this period.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">How long will my erection last after sex?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Sildenafil doesnâ€™t stop your erection going down after ejaculation - your erection should go away after you have had sex.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">How long does it take to work?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>As a general rule you should take sildenafil tablets up to 1 hour before having sex. It will normally begin to work anywhere between 30 minutes and 1 hour after you take it. The time it takes to take effect can vary from person to person, as well as external factors, such as when you last ate.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">Can I take it as often as I want?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>You should only take one tablet in a 24-hour period.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">What happens if it doesn't work?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Sildenafil (and other ED treatments) are not always effective for everyone the first time they take them. Official advice is that you should try a dose up to 8 times before deciding that it is ineffective. If you still find that it is ineffective after multiple attempts, you should speak to your doctor about alternative treatment options.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">Do I need a prescription to buy Sildenafil tablets?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Yes - our doctors will write a private prescription for our pharmacy if they deem it safe and appropriate after your online consultation.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">Where will my medicine come from?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>We've teamed up with a leading, fully-regulated UK online pharmacy who are our partner for evaluating and dispensing prescription medicine. They've experienced doctors and pharmacists who are clinical experts in Erectile Dysfunction treatment.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Safety questions</h2>
		<button class="accordion">Is it safe?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Yes - as long as patients answer questions truthfully, accurately, and completely.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">What dosage should I take?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>The starting dose for most men is 50mg. If 50mg does not have an effect after 8 times, then switch to 100mg. If you have existing heart conditions, you should talk to your doctor about starting sildenafil - they may decide that 25mg is a better option for you.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">Is it safe to use Sildenafil alongside other medication?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>You should avoid the following: Nitrates (glyceryl trinitrate spray & isosorbide mononitrate or dinitrate), Poppers (amyl nitrate), Protease inhibitors (HIV treatment) and Alpha-blockers (doxazosin, prazosin, or terazosin).</p>
			<p>As all ED treatments work in a similar way, you should not take any other ED treatments (such as Viagra, Cialis, Tadalafil, or Levitra) within 24 hours of sildenafil. Always speak to your doctor or pharmacist before seeking alternative ED treatments.</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">What are the possible side effects of Sildenafil tablets?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Common Side effects may include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Headache</li>
				<li>Feeling sick</li>
				<li>Hot flushes, including facial flushing</li>
				<li>A colour tinge to your vision or blurred vision</li>
				<li>Stuffy nose</li>
				<li>Diziness</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Common side effects happen in more than 1 in 100 people. If you get these side effects, you can keep taking the medicine, but tell your doctor or pharmacist if these side effects bother you or don't go away.</p>
			<p>Serious side effects may include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Chest pains - if this happens during or after sex, get into a semi-sitting position and try to relax, do not use nitrates to treat your chest pain</li>
				<li>Prolonged and sometimes painful erections - if you have an erection which lasts for more than 4 hours, contact a doctor immediately</li>
				<li>A sudden decrease or loss of vision</li>
				<li>A serious skin reaction - symptoms may include fever, severe peeling and swelling of the skin, blistering of the mouth, genitals and around the eyes</li>
				<li>Seizures</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Serious side effects are rare and happen in less than 1 in 1,000 people. <strong>Stop taking Sildenafil and tell a doctor straight away if you experience a serious side effect.</strong></p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">Will taking more than 100mg of sildenafil give me a better erection?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>No - clinical studies have shown that doses above 100mg of Sildenafil are no more effective at producing an erection but significantly increase the chances of side effects. You should not take more than 100mg of sildenafil in a 24-hour period.</p>
